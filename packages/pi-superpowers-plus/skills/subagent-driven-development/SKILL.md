# Subagent-Driven Development

Execute plan by dispatching a fresh implementer subagent per task, a task review (spec compliance + code quality) after each, and a broad whole-branch review at the end.

**Why subagents:** You delegate tasks to specialized agents with isolated context. By precisely crafting their instructions and context, you ensure they stay focused and succeed at their task. They should never inherit your session's context or history — you construct exactly what they need. This also preserves your own context for coordination work.

**Core principle:** Fresh subagent per task + task review (spec + quality) + broad final review = high quality, fast iteration

## Prerequisites
- Active branch (not main) or user-confirmed intent to work on main
- Approved plan or clear task scope

**Narration:** between tool calls, narrate at most one short line — the
ledger and the tool results carry the record.

**Continuous execution:** Do not pause to check in with your human partner between tasks. Execute all tasks from the plan without stopping. The only reasons to stop are: BLOCKED status you cannot resolve, ambiguity that genuinely prevents progress, or all tasks complete. "Should I continue?" prompts and progress summaries waste their time — they asked you to execute the plan, so execute the plan.

## When to Use

```dot
digraph when_to_use {
    "Have implementation plan?" [shape=diamond];
    "Tasks mostly independent?" [shape=diamond];
    "Stay in this session?" [shape=diamond];
    "subagent-driven-development" [shape=box];
    "executing-plans" [shape=box];
    "Manual execution or brainstorm first" [shape=box];

    "Have implementation plan?" -> "Tasks mostly independent?" [label="yes"];
    "Have implementation plan?" -> "Manual execution or brainstorm first" [label="no"];
    "Tasks mostly independent?" -> "Stay in this session?" [label="yes"];
    "Tasks mostly independent?" -> "Manual execution or brainstorm first" [label="no - tightly coupled"];
    "Stay in this session?" -> "subagent-driven-development" [label="yes"];
    "Stay in this session?" -> "executing-plans" [label="no - parallel session"];
}
```

**vs. Executing Plans (parallel session):**
- Same session (no context switch)
- Fresh subagent per task (no context pollution)
- Review after each task (spec compliance + code quality), broad review at the end
- Faster iteration (no human-in-loop between tasks)

**Dependent tasks:** Most real plans have some dependencies. For dependent tasks, include the previous task's implementation summary and relevant file paths in the next subagent's context. Track what each completed task produced so you can pass it forward.

```

## Setup

Call `set_phase({ phase: "development" })` at the start of the skill.

Ensure the work happens in an isolated workspace: use
`/skill:using-git-worktrees` to create one or verify the existing one.
Never start implementation on a main/master branch without your human
partner's explicit consent.

Conversation memory does not survive compaction. In real sessions,
controllers that lost their place have re-dispatched entire completed task
sequences — the single most expensive failure observed. Track progress in
a ledger file, not only in todos.

- Each plan owns a workspace: at skill start, run this skill's
  `scripts/sdd-workspace PLAN_FILE` — it prints the plan's git-ignored
  directory (`<repo-root>/.superpowers/sdd/<plan-basename>/`), home to
  every artifact for THIS plan: ledger, briefs, reports, review packages.
  Another plan's directory is never yours to read or write.
- Check for this plan's ledger at `<workspace>/progress.md`. If its first
  line names your plan file, tasks with a `Task <N>: complete` line are DONE
  — do not re-dispatch them; resume at the first task without one. A task
  whose last line is a fix round is mid-loop: resume the loop at the next
  round. A ledger whose first line names a different plan file — or a stray
  ledger at the old flat path `.superpowers/sdd/progress.md` — is another
  plan's progress: leave it in place and start your own, fresh.
- Create the ledger with its identity as the first line:
  `# SDD ledger — plan: <plan file path>`.
- The ledger is your recovery map: the commits it names exist in git even
  when your context no longer remembers creating them. After compaction,
  trust the ledger and `git log` over your own recollection.
- `git clean -fdx` will destroy the workspace (it's git-ignored scratch); if
  that happens, recover from `git log`.

Read the molecule once (`bd mol current <implement-step-id> --json`), note its context
and Global Constraints from each task bead's description, and confirm the
`plan-approved` gate is closed (`bd show <plan-approved-gate-id>`) before dispatching any
subagent. Task ids and their `needs` ordering already exist as real dependency edges —
no `TaskCreate`-equivalent step is needed here; `writing-plans` already created them
(see its Task Structure section).

Before dispatching Task 1, scan the plan once for conflicts:

- tasks that contradict each other or the plan's Global Constraints
- anything the plan explicitly mandates that the review rubric treats as a
  defect (a test that asserts nothing, verbatim duplication of a logic block)

Present everything you find to your human partner as one batched question —
each finding beside the plan text that mandates it, asking which governs —
before execution begins, not one interrupt per discovery mid-plan. If the
scan is clean, proceed without comment. The review loop remains the net for
conflicts that only emerge from implementation.

## The Task Loop

Everything you paste into a dispatch prompt — and everything a subagent
prints back — stays resident in your context for the rest of the session
and is re-read on every later turn. Hand artifacts over as files.

### 1. Dispatch the implementer

Record BASE (`git rev-parse HEAD`) before dispatching — the review package
and fix-round diffs need it.

- **Task brief:** before dispatching an implementer, run this skill's
  `scripts/task-brief PLAN_FILE N` — it extracts the task's full text to a
  uniquely named file and prints the path. The extractor relies on the plan
  format that `/skill:writing-plans` mandates: tasks are delimited by an
  unfenced `---` on its own line (before the next `### Task` heading, and
  before any trailing section after the last task). Tasks written to that
  format extract cleanly — including the last task, which ends at the
  `---`-before-trailing-section instead of running off the end of the
  plan. Compose the dispatch so the
  brief stays the single source of requirements. Your dispatch should
  contain: (1) one line on where this task fits in the project; (2) the
  brief path, introduced as "read this first — it is your requirements,
  with the exact values to use verbatim"; (3) interfaces and decisions from
  earlier tasks that the brief cannot know; (4) your resolution of any
  ambiguity you noticed in the brief; (5) the report-file path and report
  contract. Exact values (numbers, magic strings, signatures, test cases)
  appear only in the brief. Never make a subagent read the whole plan file.
- **Report file:** name the implementer's report file after the brief
  (brief `…/task-N-brief.md` → report `…/task-N-report.md`) and put it in
  the dispatch prompt. The implementer writes the full report there and
  returns only status, commits, a one-line test summary, and concerns.
- A dispatch prompt describes one task, not the session's history. Do not
  paste accumulated prior-task summaries ("state after Tasks 1-3") into
  later dispatches. A fresh subagent needs its task, the interfaces it
  touches, and the global constraints. Nothing else.
- If an earlier task parked a finding in the area this task touches, carry
  a pointer to that ledger entry in the dispatch.
- Record the implementer's agent ID from the `Agent(...)` dispatch result —
  fix-loop rounds 1-3 resume this agent via `Agent({ subagent_type:
  "implementer", resume: <agent_id>, ... })`.
- Never dispatch multiple implementation subagents in parallel (conflicts).
- Never hand bead management to the implementer. Task tracking (creating, updating, closing this task's bead) is the controller's job alone, and the task closes only after its review passes. The implementer prompt template carries this guardrail — do not override it.

Template: [implementer-prompt.md](implementer-prompt.md)

### 2. Handle the report

Implementer subagents report one of four statuses. Handle each appropriately:

**DONE:** Generate the review package (`scripts/review-package PLAN_FILE BASE HEAD`, from this skill's directory — it prints the unique file path it wrote; BASE is the commit you recorded before dispatching the implementer — never `HEAD~1`, which silently drops all but the last commit of a multi-commit task), then dispatch the task reviewer with the printed path.

**DONE_WITH_CONCERNS:** The implementer completed the work but flagged doubts. Read the concerns before proceeding. If the concerns are about correctness or scope, address them before review. If they're observations (e.g., "this file is getting large"), note them and proceed to review.

**NEEDS_CONTEXT:** The implementer needs information that wasn't provided. Provide the missing context and re-dispatch.

**BLOCKED:** The implementer cannot complete the task. Assess the blocker:
1. If it's a context problem, provide more context and re-dispatch
2. If the task requires more reasoning, re-dispatch
3. If the task is too large, break it into smaller pieces
4. If the plan itself is wrong, escalate to the human

Update the task's bead: `beads_update({ id: "<id>", status: "blocked", appendNotes: "<blocker>" })`. If the task is later re-dispatched (anything other than escalate-to-human), re-mark it `in_progress` when work resumes — never leave it silently in `in_progress`/`open`.

**Never** ignore an escalation or force a retry without changes. If the implementer said it's stuck, something needs to change.

If the implementer asks questions — before starting or mid-task — answer
clearly and completely, provide additional context if needed, and don't
rush it into implementation.

### 3. Review the task

Per-task reviews are task-scoped gates. The broad review happens once, at the
final whole-branch review. Never skip the task review, and never accept a
report missing either verdict — spec compliance AND task quality are both
required. Implementer self-review never replaces the task review; both are
needed.

- Hand the reviewer its diff as a file: run this skill's
  `scripts/review-package PLAN_FILE BASE HEAD` and pass the reviewer the file path
  it prints (or, without bash: `git log --oneline`, `git diff --stat`,
  and `git diff -U10` for the range, redirected to one uniquely named
  file). The output never enters your own context, and the reviewer sees
  the commit list, stat summary, and full diff with context in one Read
  call. Use the BASE you recorded before dispatching the implementer —
  never `HEAD~1`, which silently truncates multi-commit tasks. Never
  dispatch a task reviewer without a diff file.
- **Reviewer inputs:** the task reviewer gets three paths — the same brief
  file, the report file, and the review package — plus the global
  constraints that bind the task.
- The global-constraints block you hand the reviewer is its attention
  lens. Copy the binding requirements verbatim from the plan's Global
  Constraints section or the spec: exact values, exact formats, and the
  stated relationships between components ("same layout as X", "matches
  Y"). The reviewer's template already carries the process rules (YAGNI,
  test hygiene, review method) — the constraints block is for what THIS
  project's spec demands.
- Do not add open-ended directives like "check all uses" or "run race tests
  if useful" without a concrete, task-specific reason
- Do not ask a reviewer to re-run tests the implementer already ran on the
  same code — the implementer's report carries the test evidence
- Do not pre-judge findings for the reviewer — never instruct a reviewer to
  ignore or not flag a specific issue. If you believe a finding would be a
  false positive, let the reviewer raise it and adjudicate it in the review
  loop. If the prompt you are writing contains "do not flag," "don't treat X
  as a defect," "at most Minor," or "the plan chose" — stop: you are
  pre-judging, usually to spare yourself a review loop.

The task reviewer may report "⚠️ Cannot verify from diff" items — requirements
that live in unchanged code or span tasks. These do not block the rest of the
review, but you must resolve each one yourself before marking the task
complete: you hold the plan and cross-task context the reviewer
lacks. If you confirm an item is a real gap, treat it as a failed spec
review — it enters the fix loop with the other findings.

Template: [task-reviewer-prompt.md](task-reviewer-prompt.md)

### 4. The fix loop

The loop triggers when the review reports spec ❌, any Critical or Important
finding, or a ⚠️ item you confirmed as a real gap.

Before the loop starts, two routes leave it immediately:

- Record Minor findings in the progress ledger as you go
  (`Task <N>: minor (deferred): <one-liner>`), and point the final
  whole-branch review at that list so it can triage which must be fixed
  before merge. A roll-up nobody reads is a silent discard. Minor findings
  never enter the loop.
- A finding labeled plan-mandated — or any finding that conflicts with
  what the plan's text requires — is the human's decision, like any plan
  contradiction: present the finding and the plan text, ask which governs.
  Do not dismiss the finding because the plan mandates it, and do not
  dispatch a fix that contradicts the plan without asking.

Everything else enters the loop. A fix round is one fix dispatch plus one
scoped re-review. Five rounds maximum per task:

**Rounds 1-3 — resume the original implementer.** Dispatch it with
`Agent({ subagent_type: "implementer", resume: <agent_id>, prompt:
"<open findings verbatim>" })`, where `<agent_id>` is the identity you
recorded when you first dispatched this task's implementer. Its context is
intact: it knows the task, the code, and its own choices. The `resume:`
parameter is real tool support from `@tintinweb/pi-subagents` — the old
"resume this agent" instruction had no tool behind it; now it does.

**Rounds 4-5 — dispatch a fresh implementer** (drop `resume:`), with the
brief path, the report-file path, the open findings, and this framing: "A
prior implementer attempted this task [N] times; you own it now. Read the
report file for what was tried." A loop that survives three resumes usually
means the implementer cannot see its own problem — fresh eyes in one move.

**Every round, either way:** the implementer fixes, re-runs the tests
covering the amended code, appends its fix report to the same report file,
and returns the short contract. Before re-dispatching the reviewer, confirm
the fix report contains the covering tests, the command run, and the
output; dispatch the re-review once all three are present. Name the
covering test files in the fix message — a one-line fix does not need the
whole suite.

**The re-review is scoped.** Run `scripts/review-package PLAN_FILE FIX_BASE HEAD`
where FIX_BASE is the head the previous review saw, and dispatch
[re-review-prompt.md](re-review-prompt.md) with the findings list, the
brief, the report file, and the printed diff path. The re-reviewer verdicts
each finding ADDRESSED or NOT ADDRESSED and flags new breakage in the fix
diff only. New Critical/Important breakage in the fix diff joins the open
findings list. Out-of-scope observations go to the ledger as deferred
minors — they never extend the loop.

**After each round,** append to the ledger:
`Task <N>: fix round <R>/5 (<X> addressed, <Y> open — <finding one-liners>; commits <a7>..<b7>)`

Never fix findings yourself in the controller session — your context stays
clean for coordination, and controller fixes skip review.

**The breaker.** When round 5's re-review still leaves findings open, stop
dispatching. Adjudicate each open finding yourself — you hold the plan and
the cross-task context the reviewer lacks:

- **The reviewer is wrong, or the point is contestable:** park it —
  `Task <N>: parked — <finding> — ruling: <why the code stands>`. The final
  review sees both sides.
- **Real, but nothing downstream builds on it:** park it the same way, with
  a ruling that says it's real and deferred.
- **Real and load-bearing** — a later task builds on it, or it reveals a
  plan defect: STOP. Append `Task <N>: BLOCKED — <reason>` and report to
  your human partner with the finding, the plan text it collides with, and
  the fix history. Parking a structural failure lets every dependent task
  build on it and hands the final review a problem it cannot fix either.

Adjudicate only at the cap. Adjudicating earlier to end a loop is
pre-judging with a different name. Every adjudication is a ledger entry —
a silent discard is forbidden.

### 5. Complete the task

When the review comes back clean — or every open finding is parked with a
ruling at the cap — append the completion line to the ledger in the same
message as your other bookkeeping:

- `Task <N>: complete (commits <base7>..<head7>, review clean)`
- `Task <N>: complete (commits <base7>..<head7>, <K> parked)` after a
  tripped breaker

Then close the task bead (`bd close <task-id> --reason "<summary>"`) and move on. Never
move to the next task while the review has open Critical/Important issues
that are neither fixed nor parked-with-ruling at the cap.

## After All Tasks Complete

When all tasks are done and reviewed, **stop and report to the user**:

1. Summarize what was implemented (tasks completed, files changed, test counts)
2. Ask: "All tasks complete. Ready for final review and finishing?"
3. **Wait for user confirmation before proceeding**

Do NOT automatically dispatch final review or start the finishing skill. The user may want to test manually, adjust scope, or take a break before the final phase.

## Final Review

After the user confirms, At the start of the skill, call `set_phase({ phase: "final review" })`.
The final whole-branch review gets a package too:
run `scripts/review-package PLAN_FILE MERGE_BASE HEAD` (MERGE_BASE is the
branch point) and dispatch the `code-reviewer` agent with the
[code-reviewer.md](../requesting-code-review/code-reviewer.md) template from
the requesting-code-review skill, passing the printed package path.

Final review findings get ONE fix dispatch (a fresh implementer) plus one
scoped re-review, then adjudicate any residuals with the breaker rules
above. When the final review is clean, delete this plan's workspace (the
record now lives in git) and use `/skill:finishing-a-development-branch`.

## When a Subagent Fails

**You are the orchestrator. You do NOT write code. You dispatch subagents that write code.**

If an implementer subagent fails, errors out, or produces incomplete work:

1. **Attempt 1:** Dispatch a NEW fix subagent with specific instructions about what went wrong and what needs to change. Include the error output and the original task text.
2. **Attempt 2:** If the fix subagent also fails, dispatch one more with a different approach or simplified scope.
3. **After 2 failed attempts: STOP.** Report the failure to the user and ask how to proceed. The task likely needs redesign.

**NEVER:**
- Write code yourself to "help" or "finish up" — you are the orchestrator, not an implementer
- Try to fix the subagent's work inline — this pollutes your context and defeats the fresh-subagent model
- Silently skip the failed task and move on
- Reduce quality gates (skip reviews) because a task is "almost done"

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Start implementation on main/master branch without explicit user consent
- Skip the task review (spec + quality)
- Proceed with unfixed issues that are neither fixed nor parked-with-ruling
- Dispatch multiple implementation subagents in parallel (conflicts)
- Make a subagent read the plan file (hand it the brief file instead)
- Skip scene-setting context (subagent needs to understand where task fits)
- Ignore subagent questions (answer before letting them proceed)
- Accept "close enough" on spec compliance
- Skip review loops (reviewer found issues = implementer fixes = re-review)
- Let implementer self-review replace the task review (both are needed)
- Move to the next task while the review has open Critical/Important issues
- Pre-judge findings for a reviewer ("do not flag", "at most Minor")
- Silently discard a finding — every adjudication is a ledger entry
- Fix findings yourself in the controller session

## Integration

**Required workflow skills:**
- **`/skill:using-git-worktrees`** - Recommended: Set up isolated workspace before starting. For small changes, branching in the current directory is acceptable with human approval.
- **`/skill:writing-plans`** - Creates the plan this skill executes
- **`/skill:requesting-code-review`** - Code review template for the final whole-branch reviewer
- **`/skill:finishing-a-development-branch`** - Complete development after final review

**Subagents follow by default:**
- **TDD** - Runtime warnings on source-before-test patterns. Implementer subagents receive three-scenario TDD instructions via agent profile and prompt template: new feature (full TDD), modifying tested code (run existing tests), trivial change (judgment call).

**Alternative workflow:**
- **`/skill:executing-plans`** - Use for parallel session instead of same-session execution
